AR3_Util
--------

AR3_Util is a set of useful classes or functions I regularly used across different projects.

Source documentation is included in docs/_build/html

Whilst the code is written with Windows/Linux cross platform support in mind, I largely test new version on Linux only.

See LICENSE.txt and VERSION_HISTORY.md for additional information.

Thank you for reading!

Arthur
