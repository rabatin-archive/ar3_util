# AR3_Util

---------------------

Introduction
---

AR3_Util is a set of useful classes or functions I regularly used across different projects.

This is a personal project and no guarantee is given that specific functionality will work or will
continue to exist in future versions.

Source documentation is included in docs/_build/html

Whilst the code is written with Windows/Linux cross platform support in mind, I largely test new version on Linux only.

For simple usage example, visit the tests module

See LICENSE.txt and VERSION_HISTORY.md for additional information.

Thank you for reading!
